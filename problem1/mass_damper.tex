\section{Introduction}
To study a motion of a mass with given initial state connected to a
wall with a spring and a damper can be done using differential
equations. Lets assume a mass (m) is connected to a wall with spring
of stiffness k and a damper of constant c. Assume that the mass m is
given a initial displacement of x and released with zero velocity
{cite the figure}. 

\subsection{Forces on mass}
Since the mass attached to a spring and a damper, there will be two forces 
on the mass.

\subsubsection{Hooke's law}

Hooke's law  states that  a spring  elongated with  an amount  dx, the
force on the object elongating is

\begin{equation}
  F_s = -kx
\end{equation}
Draw a figure here.

\subsubsection{Damping force}

The force from the damper to reduce the energy of
the mass is 
\begin{equation}
  F_d = -c\frac{dx}{dt}
\end{equation}

The total force on the mass neglecting gravity at a given time is

\begin{equation}
  F_{total} = F_s + F_d
\end{equation}
